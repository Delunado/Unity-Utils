# Unity Utils

Here you can find my own *Unity Utils*, pieces of reusable code I've been making and using through the years across several projects. 

All the scripts are under the namespace **Delu** to avoid any conflicts.

### ~ Steerings Behaviour Manager ~

A Steerings Behaviour component to apply steering behaviours to a moving Game Object. You have to add it to the Game Object and reference it from another script, in order to easily use with your movement controller. Find it [here](https://github.com/Delunado/Unity-Utils/blob/main/SteeringBehaviourManager.cs).

### ~ Persistent Singleton ~

This component allows to apply the Persistent Singleton pattern to a Monobehaviour. Just make the component you want to be persistent singleton inherit from the PersistentSingleton class. Find it [here]() 

<br>

### ~ Timer ~

An easy-to-use Timer. You can use it on Update & Fixed Update. Find it [here](https://github.com/Delunado/Unity-Utils/blob/main/Timer.cs).

<br>

### ~ Data Objects ~
Some Scriptable Objects that allow us to create Int, Float, Bool, etc. objects and use them as we want. Useful for sharing data between entities easily, for example. Find it [here](https://github.com/Delunado/Unity-Utils/tree/main/DataObjects)

### ~ General Utils ~

Some general utilities:

-  Get Mouse Position: Returns the mouse position in 2D world coordinates.
