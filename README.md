# Unity Utils

Here you can find my own *Unity Utils*, pieces of reusable code I've been making and using through the years across several projects. 

All the scripts are under the namespace **Delu** to avoid any conflicts.



### Timer

An easy-to-use Timer. You can use it on Update & Fixed Update. Find it [here](https://github.com/Delunado/Unity-Utils/blob/main/Timer.cs).



### General Utils

Some general utilities:

-  Get Mouse Position: Returns the mouse position in 2D world coordinates.
